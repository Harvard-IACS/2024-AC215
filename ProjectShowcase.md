There are a lot of things to keep in mind (such as drink ingredients, tools, garnishes, whether or not to add ice, etc.). Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop an application that can allow for users to rely on a virtual bartender, Eustace, who will easily generate cocktail recipe recommendations based on the user’s mood, situation, and/or household ingredients. With every interaction, users can expect a unique and thoughtful experience, where cocktail-making becomes both a creative journey and a delightful discovery, tailored just for them. | <img src="../assets/projects/SpiritMatch.png" width="200"/> |
| **16. Yarn Master** <br><br> It’s really common to find crochet products we’d love to make ourselves, but finding clear, step-by-step instructions can be really challenging. Currently, there isn’t an AI-powered tool that can effectively generate meaningful crochet instructions. We came up with the idea of developing a deep learning model specifically designed for crochet products. Users would be able to upload pictures of crochet items they find interesting, and the model would generate detailed instructions for recreating those products. | <img src="../assets/projects/YarnMaster.jpg" width="200"/> |
