| Description |  |
|------------|-------|
| **1. DecAide** <br><br> Our tool allows for celebrity stylists, people who need an efficient way to understand historical fashion references, to style their clients using clothing featured on high fashion runways. Our app takes images of outfits, identifies the year that each outfit most closely resembles, and provides recommendations and information to the user based off of that decade and its popular trends. | <img src="../assets/projects/DecAide.png" width="200"/> |
| **2. SnapChef** <br><br> An app that identifies dishes from images, generates detailed recipes, and tailors them to individual preferences and dietary needs could empower food enthusiasts to recreate dishes seen on social media or in restaurants effortlessly. | <img src="../assets/projects/SnapChef.png" width="200"/> |
| **3. CareConverse** <br><br> CareConverse is an LLM-powered chatbot to surface personalized information on optimal chronic disease management. By utilizing a large language model (LLM) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), CareConverse will deliver concise, pertinent context to patients looking for clarity, reassurance and direction on their disease experience, along with citations and links to relevant content. This approach ensures transparency and trust, as users can verify the information and further explore the literature. | <img src="../assets/projects/CareConverse.png" width="200"/> |
| **4. Pourfect AI** <br><br> PourfectAI is a conversational chatbot bartender that blends expert mixology knowledge with the convenience of a personal recommendation system. PourfectAI suggests the perfect drink based on user preferences, mood, ingredients on hand, or even dietary needs—whether it’s a fresh mocktail or a classic cocktail with a twist. PourfectAI -- where every pour is perfectly yours! | <img src="../assets/projects/pourfectAI.jpg" width="200"/> |
| **4. ClinIQ** <br><br> To develop a diagnostic medical assistant tool where clinicians can input symptoms/patient notes into a chatbot and receive possible diagnoses and recommended medications to guide faster, more accurate diagnoses. | <img src="../assets/projects/ClinIQ-Logo.png" width="200"/> |
