## Milestone 3 : Midterm Presentation 

### **Overview**

In the past few weeks, we’ve explored the development of AI applications, focusing on:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques.
- **Fine-tuning models** for enhanced performance.
- Utilizing **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for cloud-based AI deployments.
- Managing **data versioning with DVC** and deploying applications using **Docker** containers.
- Employing **Vertex AI** for scalable model training and deployment.

For this milestone, you will present your AI application in the form of an **investor pitch**. Your objective is to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and persuasively while demonstrating the potential business impact of your AI solution. Your presentation should:


### **Key Dates**
- **Presentation Date:** Thursday, October 31st.
    Details on the schedule and location will be posted on **Ed**.

  **Slides submission:** Please submit slides by noon on 10/31 via Canvas.


### **Presentation Requirements**
Your presentation should be **5 minutes** long, followed by **1 minute** for Q&A. It should include:

**1. Problem Statement and Target Audience**
- **Define the Problem:**
    Clearly articulate the specific problem your AI application addresses.
- **Identify the Target Audience:**
    Describe who will benefit from your solution (e.g., specific industries, user groups).

**2. Unique Value Proposition**
- **Highlight Uniqueness:**
    Explain what sets your solution apart from existing alternatives.
- **Demonstrate Value:**
    Illustrate how your AI application provides unique benefits to the target audience.


**3. Scalability and Efficiency**
- **Technical Scalability:**
    Discuss how your application can scale to meet growing demands.
- **Performance Optimization:**
    Explain any optimizations implemented for efficiency (e.g., fine-tuning, infrastructure choices).
- **Infrastructure Considerations:**
    Briefly mention the technologies used (e.g., GCP, Docker, Vertex AI) and why they were chosen.

**4. Future Development and Growth Potential**
- **Next Steps:**
    Outline your plans for further development of the AI application.
- **Market Growth:**
    Discuss the potential for market expansion and how your solution can adapt.



### **Be Prepared to Answer Questions On**
- **Technical Architecture and Infrastructure Choices**
    Why did you choose specific tools and platforms?
    How does your architecture support scalability and reliability?
- **Data Management and Security**
    How do you handle data versioning and storage?
    What measures are in place to ensure data security and compliance (if applies)?
- **Model Performance, Optimization, and Maintenance**
    What are the performance metrics of your model?
    How will you maintain and update the model over time?
- **Market Opportunity**
    What is the size of the market you are targeting?
    How does your solution meet a demand or gap in the market?


### **Presentation Guidelines**
- **Audience Consideration:**
    Tailor your presentation to be accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Engaging Narrative:**
    Tell a compelling story that connects the technical aspects to real-world impact.
- **Visual Aids:**
    Use clear and effective visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) to illustrate key points.
- **Time Management:**
    Practice to ensure you cover all points within the 5-minute timeframe.



### **Deliverables**
**Note:** All deliverables must be submitted via GitHub (milestone3 branch), submit full commit hash on Canvas.

**1. Presentation Slides** 

**2. Code submission, similar to Milestone 2** Any additions/modifications must be highlighted in the README.md file.

### **Evaluation Criteria**
Your presentation will be assessed based on:
- **Technical Depth (30%):**
    Clarity and accuracy in explaining your AI application’s technical aspects.
- **Business Acumen (25%):**
    Effectiveness in conveying the market potential and value proposition.
- **Clarity and Structure (20%):**
    Organization of content and logical flow of the presentation.
- **Visual Communication (15%):**
    Use of visuals to enhance understanding.
- **Engagement and Delivery (10%):**
    Presentation style and ability to engage the audience, including during Q&A.
