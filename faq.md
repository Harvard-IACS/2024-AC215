**Is there a class GitHub repository?**

Indeed. You can find it at [https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2024-AC215](https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2024-AC215).

**Is it necessary for me to be present for the live lectures?**

While university policies require all AC215 students to attend the lectures, we don’t officially record attendance.  Attendance is crucial for earning late days should you wish to utilize during the semester (See [Course Policies](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2024-AC215/#course-policies))

It’s worth mentioning that all lectures are videotaped, so you can watch them later if you can’t attend. However, missing the live sessions means you’ll miss the opportunity for real-time interaction with the instructors and your classmates.

**Can I view the video recordings for the course?**

Absolutely. All students enrolled in AC215 will have access to video recordings.

**Can I audit this class?** 

All course materials are publicly available, and you are free to access them as long as you adhere to our policies.
Auditing the class allows you access to the materials and the ability to attend lectures in person. However, we cannot provide auditors with access to Canvas or the recorded videos. Additionally, auditors are not permitted to use any resources, including time with the teaching staff. In summary, you are welcome to attend lectures and access the materials, but please do not ask questions or participate in discussions.
